## Brief Description
This project is to take in a file of code and translate it into another language 
that is optimized and executable.

## Architecture
This project uses the OpenAI's GPT-4o and the Anthropic's Claude 3.5 
Sonnet models to ensure the executability of the translated code while still 
guaranteeing the optimization of the code.

For more information about the model, please read the following documentation:

- [Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming)

## Instructions of Use

## Dedication
I dedicate this hard-work commitment to myself, my mother, my best friend 
Ha-Phuong and those that have imprinted in my heart. I hope that I have made 
you all truly proud of me.
